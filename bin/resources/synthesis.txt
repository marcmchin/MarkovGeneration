The Aunts’ shadowy figures pace the perimeter of the gym. Rows and rows of Handmaids lie silently on army cots, their uniforms creating a dark sea of red [AbP]. After weeks and weeks of daily lessons, there are two warring voices in their heads. For some, the Aunts’ impassioned exclamations overpower their misgivings about the new nation, their new roles. Others cast aside the Aunts’ words defiantly, vowing never to conform [PrPP]. But still, there are some who sit on the fence, quietly going along, quietly questioning the system [PrPP]. Quietly, because they do not have the power to change anything [ADVSC]. To survive in this new world, they have to let go of their old selves, lie back, and allow "Handmaid" replace who they are. The strict teachings forced on the women push aside everything they had once known, everything they had once been, reducing them to wombs. Handmaids. In the Red Center, Handmaids are fed new beliefs and forced into new roles. All of this is simply a way for the authoritarian government to control Gilead’s fertility rate. Like Handmaids, the Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group who live primarily in Xinjiang, China, are subjected to thorough reeducation [AP]. As seen in Gilead of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and in modern-day China, oppressive governments use reeducation to obtain control, even if for different purposes and with different means, simultaneously stripping targeted groups of people of their identities and beliefs [PrPP]. 
Authoritarian governments like Atwood’s dystopian Gilead and today’s China target specific groups of people to obtain control of resources, often giving distorted reasoning as justification. In Gilead, Handmaids are "women recruited for reproductive purposes" who the government acquired by "declaring all second marriages and nonmarital liaisons adulterous" (Atwood 304)[ADJSC]. In short, the Gileadean government fabricated the argument that these women possessed poor morals and had sinned to justify repurposing them solely for reproduction. A similar justification of measures is also seen in China. A politically important region rich in resources, Xinjiang is vital to China; thus, the government views control of the land and its people as highly important [AP][CPwCA]. A spokesperson of the Mission of China to the EU asserts that Xinjiang’s reeducation camps are part of "counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures" and exist to wipe out Uyghur "separatists, religious extremists and terrorists," who have been an issue in Xinjiang for decades ("Spokesperson of Chinese Mission…")[ADJSC]. Contrary to what the Chinese government has claimed, Western media sources have found mounting evidence that Xinjiang’s reeducation camps and restrictive laws attempt to eliminate the Uyghurs’ culture and religious beliefs. The US government and other Western nations have proclaimed that China’s actions go beyond counterterrorism and in truth are "genocide and crimes against humanity" (Abdilim). While both China and Gilead have excuses to justify their use of reeducation on specific groups of people, it is clear in each case that these surface claims are simply cover-ups and that the underlying motive is control of resources.
In order to secure tight control over their resources, authoritarian governments often target people’s beliefs, as a person’s actions are strongly influenced by their beliefs [ADVSC]. The women apprehended to become Handmaids likely did not have a common religion or belief system like the Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group, do. However, both of these groups are coerced to adhere to a specific set of beliefs and practices. With The Handmaid’s Tale, the first of two main ideas perpetuated by the Aunts was that women are far better off after the formation of Gilead [PaPP]. As proof of "what they thought of women, then," Aunt Lydia showed pornography in which women were "raped, beaten up, [and] killed" to the Handmaids at the Red Center (Atwood 118). In Gilead, women no longer have to deal with men abusing and taking advantage of them, a change that Offred said Aunt Lydia termed "freedom from" (Atwood 24). Secondly, the Aunts taught the Handmaids conservative Christian values. When she saw several female Japanese travelers, Offred was stunned by their short skirts, open-toe shoes, and overall lack of modesty, even though Offred thinks to herself, "I used to dress like that" (Atwood 28)[ADVSC]. This demonstrates a stark alteration of her original beliefs. In Xinjiang, Uyghurs are being labeled as extremists and sent to reeducation camps solely because they are Muslim, as reported by human rights groups (Maizland). The Chinese government has allegedly prevented Uyghurs from practicing Islam. One woman who had been in a Xinjiang reeducation center for two years reported that guards and teachers would punish the Uyghurs if they were seen praying, the punishment a sign that the Chinese officials are suppressing the Uyghur’s faith (Haitiwaji and Morgat)[AbP]. According to leaked Chinese documents found by the BBC, Uyghurs are forced to "[transform] their behaviour, beliefs and language" ("Data Leak…"). For both the Uyghurs and the Handmaids, there are constant demands for them to relinquish their previous beliefs and accept those fed to them by the government.
Intertwined with beliefs is a sense of identity. Gilead and China both use reeducation to strip people of their previous selves, forcing on them a new identity and purpose [PrPP]. In Gilead, the Handmaids’ purpose is to reproduce, so the Red Center prepares them to fulfill that responsibility. Although these women had children prior to the formation of Gilead, their role in society was not limited solely to reproduction [ADVSC]. Offred, for example, used to have a job working at a library (Atwood 171). After being in the Red Center, Handmaids are reduced to "two-legged wombs," a single function that dehumanizes them (Atwood 136)[AM]. Offred also notes that, in Gilead, her body "determines [her] so completely" and is the only thing that matters about her (Atwood 63). As seen in China, Xinjiang’s reeducation camps are, as anthropologist Dr. Adrian Zenz calls them, "a whole program of assimilation" (Girard). One’s identity stems primarily from one’s upbringing, the time when language, beliefs, and culture are acquired. The Chinese government has banned the teaching of the Uyghur language in Xinjiang schools, lab  eled the practice of Islam a "sign of extremism," and destroyed "dozens of graveyards and religious sites" (Serhan). In teaching only Mandarin Chinese, forcing detainees to learn "patriotic Chinese songs", and "listen to lectures… preaching gratitude to the Communist Party", the Chinese government is attempting to rework the Uyghur people’s identity into that of an ideal Han Chinese society (Buckley and Ramzy). Ironically, the oppression of their religion and culture made Uyghurs, like Mihrigul Tursun, who has been through one of Xinjiang’s reeducation camps, "more conscious of [their] ethnic identity" (Zenz). Even Offred, a Handmaid who doesn’t agree with the Gileadean system, was swayed by the government’s teachings, even to the point where she thought of her past actions as senseless; in contrast, many Uyghurs continue to hold firmly to their identities and beliefs [AP][ADJSC][CPwCA].
Unlike in Gilead, where Handmaids are highly valued for their reproductive abilities, China is focused on Xinjiang’s resources, with little regard for the Uyghur people [ADJSC]. The Gileadean government’s goal is to control the Handmaids themselves, so they attempt to make the Handmaids content in their roles. As Aunt Lydia claims, the Handmaid position is "not a prison but a privilege" as they bear a special responsibility to reproduce for Gilead (Atwood 8)[ADVSC]. Intercourse between the Commanders and the Handmaids is also sanctified, sanctified in its title, the Ceremony (Atwood 93)[RWM]. Conversely, the Chinese government is attempting to eliminate any differences between Uyghurs and the rest of the Han Chinese. The message, conveyed through the government’s strict reeducation, is that China does not want the Uyghurs to exist uniquely which oppresses them as a people [PaPP]. Because the end goal of the reeducation camps is to control the Xinjiang region and not use the people for a specific purpose, there is little regard for the wellbeing of the Uyghurs [ADVSC]. In fact, escaped Uyghurs have spoken to western news agencies, reporting the torture and physical abuse that they experienced while in the reeducation camps (Haitiwaji and Morgat)[PrPP]. This is a stark difference from the Handmaids, as they are given only "healthy food" and taught that their bodies are "sacred vessels" due to the reproductive focus of the Gileadean government (Atwood 136, 65). 
Xinjiang is an unsettling reminder of how seemingly preposterous fictional societies like Gilead aren’t so far from reality. These authoritarian governments established specialized facilities and restrictions to control their people, erasing identities and beliefs in the process [PrPP]. Under the guise of counterterrorism, China is attempting to assimilate an entire ethnic group. In order to boost the nation’s fertility rate, Gilead is taking away women’s bodily autonomy. These governments’ control of identity and beliefs through reeducation reveals their disregard for people’s individual rights. Even when a government’s actions may benefit a society on a national level, they should not infringe on individual freedom and dignity.
